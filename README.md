## What is Yaffle?
Yaffle is a simple game of football prediction. It tests your knowledge of European football by asking you to predict which team will win in leagues around Europe. You have to do this when the window is open at the start of the season (Usually a few weeks into the season).

Yaffle is run on Google App Engine,[here](http://yaffle-2016.appspot.com) and is optimized for phones and tablets over desktop web browsers. You can manage your teams by logging in with your pin which is sent to you by email. 

More details on the game can be found [here](http://yaffle-2016.appspot.com/www/about.html):

The game is deliberately designed to be 'light touch'. Unlike Fantasy Football games, once you have set up your teams you can sit back and watch yourself move up (or maybe down) the leaderboard for the rest of the season if you don't want to spend too much time managing your teams. It is possible to win Yaffle if you chose this strategy, however if you want to try to improve your performance, you will be able to by getting the opportunity to substitute your teams throughout the season.

**How can I win Yaffle?**

Once you have chosen your 8 teams, you will appear on the Yaffle leaderboard. Your total points score on the Yaffle leaderboard is the sum of all your teams current points total in their respective leagues. 

Although this year, there's an added twist. 4 of your teams are the teams which finish _last_ in their league.  Your relegation teams' scores are _subtracted_ from your score

Every time your teams play, your total Yaffle points change, resulting in you either going up or down the leaderboard.

The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the season when all leagues have been completed. Play-offs are not counted for Yaffle.

## How much does it cost

Yaffle is free this season for the season, although normally an entry fee of Â£10 is applied. This goes toward the prize fund. 100% of all entry fees goes into the prize fund.
## What can I win?

The cash pool is usually split between the top 3 finishers on the Leaderboard at the end of the season. It depends on how many players we have but usually the prize fund is split as follows:

* 1st: 65% of the prize fund
* 2nd: 25% of the prize fund
* 3rd: 10% of the prize fund

There are other non-cash prizes available as well, all with strange football-related names such as :
* The Roy Race Award for Total Football Management: AKA - Manager of the Year
* The Mike Basset Memorial Plaque for Total Football Mismanagement: AKA - Worst manager of the Year
* The Diana Ross Trophy for Services to Football ignorance: AKA - The Wooden Spoon
* The Ferguson/MacGregor Clock for Best Team Effort Near a Golf Course: Best Team golf prize won at the annual end of season Yaffle Prizegiving/Golf Day

## What do I do if I want to join

Yaffle is kept deliberately small, so it is not possible to self-register, so you must first indicate you want to play before the season deadline. You can do this by Email Text Facebook etc. You will then receive your user ID and PIN which you can use to access your Yaffle Profile. You can enter your teams up until the Season deadline . After that deadline you can still access your profile but you cannot edit your teams.

## What if I don't like my Teams
Everyone makes dodgy choices now and again, and you may end up being lumbered with a team that showed great promise at the start of the season that turn out to be a bunch of turkeys. Don't worry though. Yaffle provides several opportunities throughout the season to substitute teams for new teams. You will be allowed to substitute one team at the end of each month between October and March. However there are conditions to each substitution.

When you make a substitution, you do not gain the points your new team has accrued up until the date of your substitution. You only start accruing your new teams points from the date of the substitution

So for example Lets say for your October substitution, you want to swap Liverpool (with 10 points) out for Chelsea in (with 20 points). You will not suddenly gain 10 points in your Yaffle score just because you have a new team with 10 points more than your old team. After the substitution, your Yaffle points total will remain unchanged.

Then let's say at the end of the season, Chelsea finish on 85 points. Because you did not start with Chelsea, your Yaffle score for your EPL team will be 75 points, NOT 85 points.

So you need to be aware that if you make any substitutions throughout the season, then your Yaffle score will most likely not match the total points score of your final set of 8 teams.

One final consideration on substitutions. Yaffle will calculate a 'value' for each substitution you make, and this value is accumulated at the end of the season to evaluate who made the best and worst substitutions throughout the year.

So continuing this example, let's say Liverpool finish on 60 points, 25 points behind Chelsea. When you subbed Liverpool out in October, they were 10 points behind, and at the end of the season they are 25 points behind. Yaffle calculates the value of this substitution as +15, since you are 15 points better off on the leaderboard simply because you made this substitution.

However be aware that substitutions can also have negative value. It is these scores that are used to determine who is best and worst managers of the season.
